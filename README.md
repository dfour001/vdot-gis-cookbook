# VDOT GIS Cookbook

## Recipes
These are small snippets of code that will demonstrate how to accomplish a specific task.  Ideally they will be written in a way that they can be copied and pasted into a new program as needed.

### Python
#### arcpy
- [Find MP of a point](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/find_point_mp.py) - Given a point geometry and rte_nm, how do I find the MP on the LRS?
- [Find Begin and End MP of a Line](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/find_line_mp.py) - Given a line geometry, how do I find the begin and end point of the line on the LRS?
- [Match Point to RTE_NM](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/match_point_to_rte_nm.py) - How can I determine the RTE_NM that a point belongs to?
- [Match Line to RTE_NM](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/match_line_to_rte_nm.py) - How can I determine the RTE_NM that a line belongs to?


#### GeoPandas
- [Load LRS into GeoPandas](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/GeoPandas/lrs_in_geopandas.py) - How do I bring the LRS and m-values into a GeoPandas script?
- [Selecting routes within a distance of a point](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/GeoPandas/select_nearby_routes.py) - How do find the rte_nm values in the lrs within a specific distance of a point?

## Online Courses
This section isn't specific to VDOT, but lists free online courses that are relevant to a GIS analyst at VDOT

- [The Nature of Geographic Information](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/natureofgeoinfo/) - An "Open Geospatial Textbook" that promotes understanding of the Geographic Information Science and Technology enterprise (GIS&T, also known as "geospatial").
- [Spatial Data Analytics for Transportation](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog855/node/508) - From Penn State, this course explores the important role GIS plays in the transportation industry. This interdisciplinary field is often referred to GIS-T. There is a natural synergy between GIS and transportation and, as a result, GIS-T has given rise to a number of specialized techniques and a wide variety of applications.
- [Earth Lab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/) - This site hosts resources developed by Earth Lab at University of Colorado, Boulder. This website contains tutorials course lessons and blog posts related to earth data science. Most of the data tutorials will teach you important R and Python techniques relevant to earth data analytics, including geospatial, social, biological, and earth systems data.
### Python
- [Advanced Python Programming for GIS](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog489/home.html) - This course from Penn State covers advanced applications of Python for developing and customizing GIS software, designing user interfaces, and solving complex geoprocessing tasks, on both proprietary and open source platforms. 
- [Geo-Python](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Part 1 of the University of Helsinki's course on Python GIS programming
- [Automating GIS-processes](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Part 2 of the University of Helsinki's course on Python GIS programming
