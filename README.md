# VDOT LRS Cookbook

## Recipes
These are small snippets of code that will demonstrate how to accomplish a specific task.  Ideally they will be written in a way that they can be copied and pasted into a new program as needed.

### Python
#### arcpy
- [Find MP of a point](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/find_point_mp.py) - Given a point geometry and rte_nm, how do I find the MP on the LRS?
- [Find Begin and End MP of a Line](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/find_line_mp.py) - Given a line geometry, how do I find the begin and end point of the line on the LRS?
- [Match Point to RTE_NM](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/match_point_to_rte_nm.py) - How can I determine the RTE_NM that a point belongs to?
- [Match Line to RTE_NM](https://github.com/dfour001/vdot-lrs-cookbook/blob/main/Python/arcpy/match_line_to_rte_nm.py) - How can I determine the RTE_NM that a line belongs to?
